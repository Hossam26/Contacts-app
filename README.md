# Employees-app

## Overview

### This is an employee's list app with a login and registration system. Each user has his/her account on the same device. Once you are logged in, you have your own employees list.

## Topics Learnt

#### I made this project as a practice of the CRUD system(C for create, R for retrieve or read, U for update, and D for delete).
#### In addition, I merged the CRUD system with a login system, so the list you only can see. 
#### I used regexp in both The CRUD and login systems to validate them.
