# Contacts-app
#this a contact list app with a login and registration system. Each user has his/her account on the same device. Once you logged in, you have your own contact list. I made this project as practice of CRUD system(C for create, R for retrieve or read, U for update and D for delete). In addation, I merged the CRUD system with a login system , so the list only you can see. For retrieving data again when the user close the browser, I used localstorage which is a very good property for saving my data in the web browser.
