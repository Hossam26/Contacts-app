# Employees-app
#this is an employees list app with a login and registration system. Each user has his/her account on the same device. Once you are logged in, you have your own employees list. I made this project as a practice of the CRUD system(C for create, R for retrieve or read, U for update and D for delete). In addition, I merged the CRUD system with a login system, so the list you only can see.
